    <h1>64 Crayons Band</h1>
    <h2>With The Sharpener!</h2>

    <p>Back in the day if you were lucky enough to get a new box of 64 crayons
        for school (with the built in sharpener!), you were one of the cool kids.
        Well, we wanted to be the cool kids and since Interstate 64 runs east to
        west through Richmond and we are a Richmond-based band, our name was born.
        The 64 Crayons Band is an acoustic based three-, four- or more piece group.
        We play a colorful variety of music from various eras including acoustic
        rock, classic rock, pop, blue-eyed soul and some originals. We are proud of
        our wall of vocals, as well as our fresh song arrangements and laid-back
        entertaining style.</p>
